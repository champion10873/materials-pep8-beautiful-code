# How to Write Beautiful Python Code With PEP 8

This repository contains code snippets shown in the tutorial on [How to Write Beautiful Python Code With PEP 8](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/).

You can uncomment the code that isn't PEP 8 compliant in the following files if you want to test the errors, linters, and autoformatters described in the tutorial:

- [`mixed_indentation.py`](./mixed_indentation.py)
- [`trailing_whitespace.py`](./trailing_whitespace.py)
- [`unfashionable.py`](./unfashionable.py)

After uncommenting the code, you can then run, lint, and format the files locally.
